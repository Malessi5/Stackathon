## Drink Randomizer
This project was developed during my time as a student at Full Stack Academy. 

It's a full-stack single-page app that uses: 
* Node.js 
* Express.js 
* React/Redux 
* Firebase's fire store database
* Material UI for styling

Future plans are to allow new users to sign up and implement user authentication.
